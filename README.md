# VolcanoLethalExperiment
This is a lethal simulation based on the twitch.tv clip found here:

https://clips.twitch.tv/TangentialDeterminedCockroachMoreCowbell

In it, the player has a card which deals 15 damage randomly split among all minions.  He also draws a card which deals 1 damage to each enemy minion and summons a 1 cost minion.  Lastly, he can use his hero power, creating at totem which has 1 or 2 hp, and may increase the damage of both spells by 1 (although now that I look at it, I forgot to implment volcano hitting for 16 instead of 15 if you roll spell damage).

The program is a simulation of many trials of this situation.  In it, the player needs to kill the 3/6 taunt while having each one of his current minions survive.

The data text file in this repo is relatively unintelligble, so if you're curious what the results were, check the writeup (which I actually posted to reddit, then copied here later).
